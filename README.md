# MHDL

Modern HDL that transcopile to existing HDLs

# What it tries to achieve?

MHDL tries to implement a more syntactic and readable language for programming FPGAs.
While Verilog has very less structure, VHDL is way too expressive.
MHDL has a very precise and parseable syntax. The language is also more strict and specific about stuff that is for simulations.

# Why transcompiling?

Writing a own synthesizer and simulator is way to much effort.
